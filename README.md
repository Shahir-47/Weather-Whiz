## dist

The `dist` (Distribution) folder contains the build output for the project. It is primarily used by Webpack to bundle and generate the optimized version of the project for deployment. This README provides an overview of the contents and features of the `Dist` folder.

### Folder Structure

The `Dist` folder includes the following components:

- **img/**: The `img/` folder holds images, icons, and gifs used in the webpage.

- **index.html**: The entry point of the application. Initially, it contains a skeleton code with a basic structure and references to necessary assets. The main JavaScript file, `main.js`, is linked here.

- **main.js**: The dynamically generated JavaScript file that handles the core functionality of the project. It provides a feature-rich weather application where users can see detailed and accurate weather information for any place.
